# ASMSimulator
Wep App Assembly Simulator

This is a javascript based assembly simulator. It uses a self created assembly language
that features the most common instructions.

A list of features can be found in the tutorial tab.

This project uses the following code from other sources:
- CodeMirror for syntax highlighting + line editor
  https://codemirror.net/
- Use codemirror-grammar to generate autocomplete + syntax highlighting.
- Twitter bootstrap to make things pretty.
- Uses eligrey/FileSaver.js to save files.
- Uses underscore js to do mapping.
- Uses JQuery to query the DOM.
- Uses Tocify to format the table of contents in the tutorial section.

Feel free to ping me if any errors are found, if I forgot to add a source, or suggestions.

*There was previously a working version with a back end but the back end didn't really add any 
significant useful functionality and was much more expensive to host. This is now a completely
front end application.
