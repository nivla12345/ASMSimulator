# ASMSimulator
Wep app assembly simulator.

There was previously a working version with a back end but given I want to host 
for free, I'm currently making changes to make this a purely front end web application.

This project uses the following code from other sources:
- CodeMirror for syntax highlighting + line editor
  https://codemirror.net/
- Twitter bootstrap to make things pretty.
- Uses eligrey/FileSaver.js to save
- Uses underscore js to do mapping
- Uses JQuery to query

Feel free to ping me if any errors are found, if I forgot to add a source, or suggestions.
