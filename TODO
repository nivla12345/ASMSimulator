TODO:
- Enable labels inside of assembly (labels can only be used for branching + subroutine ops)

Steps to take:
 o) There are 2 cases where labels are used:
   1) Defining the label (Add to a list "label_definitions")
   2) When the label is used in branching (Add to separate list "label_uses")

 o) After iterating over all the lines, check at the end that label_uses is a subset of
    label_definitions. If not, add the error to the error list.

 o) Iterate through the code and substitute 2) with the lines2mem appropriate addresses.

- Enable search inside of the main memory box and jump to the
  appropriate address
- Format main memory to look pretty
- Format console to look pretty
- Stop program button with interrupt
- Go through TODOs in code
- Scroll with pc
- Link main memory location to line number in code to highlight section
  of code hit in text editor
- Save and load
- Set up debug button (heed breakpoints)
- Make sure you can't set breakpoints on lines that make no sense
- Use the twitter bootstrap button feature to blank out the button while 
  running
- Before running, re-program memory if not at breakpoint. This allows for 
  back to back runs
- Implement JSR and RTN
- Give code specific color + auto complete
- Square bracket to dereference (this will need to be done in run time)
- Write up tutorial
- Have different CPU speeds
- Add a features page

Cool future ideas
- Enable hardware customization
- Enable choosing textarea editor

DONE:
- Clear console
- Run and step
- Format registers to look pretty 
  (what's left here is to get the table to not change size randomly)
  (might also want to change a few magic strings)
- Have hex and decimal mode
