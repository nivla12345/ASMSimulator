TODO:
- Format registers to look pretty 
  (what's left here is to get the table to not change size randomly)
  (might also want to change a few magic strings)
- Have hex and decimal mode
- Enable labels inside of assembly
- Enable search inside of the main memory box and jump to the
  appropriate address
- Format main memory to look pretty
- Format console to look pretty
- Write up tutorial
- Have different CPU speeds
- Stop program button with interrupt
- Go through TODOs in code
- Scroll with pc
- Link main memory location to line number in code to highlight section
  of code hit in text editor
- Save and load
- Set up debug button (heed breakpoints)
- Make sure you can't set breakpoints on lines that make no sense

Cool future ideas
