TODO:
- Add stack pointer highlighting, given my implementation the SP and PC should never collide
- Have different CPU speeds
- Use the twitter bootstrap button feature to blank out the button while 
  running
- Pause program button
- Give code specific color + auto complete
- Enable inputting negative numbers
- Change main memory values to hex on hex change.
- Write up tutorial
- Add a features page

Cool future ideas
- Allow labelling of specific memory locations.
- Square bracket to dereference (this will need to be done in run time)
- Link main memory location to line number in code to highlight section
  of code hit in text editor (only do this if change to bytemode)
- Enable hardware customization
- Enable choosing textarea editor
- Before running, re-program memory if not at breakpoint. This allows for 
  back to back runs. The problem here is that after stepping, a run would reprogram the whole
  program.
- Set up debug button (heed breakpoints)
- Enable search inside of the main memory box and jump to the
  appropriate address (only do this with a dropdown search).

DONE:
- Make sure you can't set breakpoints on comments + blanklines
- Clear console
- Run and step
- Format registers to look pretty 
  (what's left here is to get the table to not change size randomly)
  (might also want to change a few magic strings)
- Have hex and decimal mode
- Enable labels inside of assembly (labels can only be used for branching + subroutine ops)
- Format main memory to look pretty
- Format console to look pretty, have auto-scroll
- Look into panels to encapsulate objects
- When breakpoint newline, update the breakpoint cookie
- Go through TODOs in code
- Scroll with pc
- Save and load
- Add label column to main memory
- Use the bootstrap glyphs
- Implement saving in JSR and RTN
