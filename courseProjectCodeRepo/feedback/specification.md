Awesome, you keep getting assigned ECE majors for project feedback :-)

### Product Backlog (10/10)
The items in the backlog should more closely represent development tasks rather than features

### Data Models (10/10)
Since the asm files are all text only, I wonder if you'll benefit from simply storing those files as plain text in the database. This could be beneficial if you don't expect them to become too long, as it maybe easier to perform searches and the line-by-line operations for the IDE.

### Wireframes or Mock-ups (10/10)
In the HTML mockups, it would be good to show what the UI looks like when there is some data (most screens were empty)

### Sprint 1 Planning (10/10)
