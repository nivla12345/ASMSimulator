Project proposal feedback
==================

**Team number**: 101<br>
**Team name**: Hotdog Crew<br>

### Arthur
I like the project. Will the machine instructions be simulated on the server side or on the client side? Remember, there should be some non-trivial data manipulation on the server-side. Maybe users could save snippets of assembly code on the service and share it with others. Maybe users could construct new programs by inserting snippets from other users - you could build a useful search system to complement that.

### Bailey
Seems like it could be a good project. I talked to Kevin about this, make sure to prioritize making a good web application over making a good simulator. I'll reiterate the sugestions I told Kevin. Things which would be good to implement: People can save their programs in the web application, (will be stored on db). People can share programs with each other, people can comment and make copies of programs (think like forking on github), people can save current run sessions as state in the database.

### Eliot
This is a pretty interesting projct and I am definitely looking forward to seeing it. Since you are planning on implementing breakpoints, do you think you will have multiple ways to run a program such as a continously or step by step? If you do end up adding problems, it would be nice feature to add a scoreboard of some sort so users can compare their solutions. Overall, it seems like you guys have a well thought out project idea.
